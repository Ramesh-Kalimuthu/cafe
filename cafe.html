<p>A Chicago-style pizza is prepared using several different styles developed in Chicago. It is also referred to as a deep-dish pizza because of its cooking style.<br>
This thick pizza is baked in a pan and layered with various delicious vegetarian and non-vegetarian toppings, cheese, and a specially prepared pizza sauce.<br>
The best way to prepare a deep-dish pizza is to layer the ingredients in the correct order properly. Adequate oil should also be placed in the pan, so the thick pizza sides get properly baked. </p>

Awesome icy treat. Perfect for when you want to have the 'coffeehouse experience' right in your own house," Jillian says. "It was so good topped off with a whipped cream and little more chocolate syrup!</p>

<p>Red velvet cake is a classic. It’s not just a cake – it’s a symbol of love. The deep, rich cocoa flavor and delicate sweetness are dreamy. It’s coated with fluffy cream cheese icing that ties all the flavors together. And the color! That deep, rich red is so satisfying to look at and so much fun to eatt just a cake – it’s a symbol of love. <br>
